I've started as assistant professor in the <a href="https://tmr.liacs.nl/">Text Mining and Retrieval Group</a> in Leiden University, at the <a href="https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/">Leiden Institute for Advanced Computer Science (LIACS)</a>, as of April 2023!

Before I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Language Sciences at Utrecht University, as a member of the research project "A composition calculus for vector-based semantic modelling with a localization for Dutch" led by Prof. Dr. Michael Moortgat. The project (funded by the NWO) aims at developing novel techniques for modelling sentences as vectorial representations, with a specific focus on specificities of the Dutch language.

Recently I defended my PhD that I pursued in the Theory Group of the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London. Under the supervision of Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh I worked on several issues in compositional distributional semantics. In particular I focused on sentence-level representations involving ellipsis and anaphora, developing a new theoretical model as well as studying its experimental implications (see my <a href="{{ base_path }}/publications/" rel="permalink">publications</a>).

Before starting the PhD in London, I received my masters degree in Logic from the <a href="https://illc.uva.nl">Institute of Logic, Language and Computation</a> in Amsterdam in 2014, and a bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a> in 2011.

In between finishing the masters and starting the PhD, I worked for a while at the Software Improvement Group, where I was co-author of two books on software (team) quality (see <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049159.do">here</a> and <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920048565.do">here</a>).
