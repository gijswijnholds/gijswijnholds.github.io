I'm a third year PhD student in the Theory Group of the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London. Under the supervision of Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh I work on several issues in compositional distributional semantics. In particular, I am interested in what a sentence-level embedding should look like, how to build representations for language involving quantifiers, ellipsis, sentence-level ambiguity, and dialogue, and what role compositionality should play in these (see my <a href="{{ base_path }}/publications/" rel="permalink">publications</a>).

Before starting the PhD in London, I received my masters degree in Logic from the <a href="https://illc.uva.nl">Institute of Logic, Language and Computation</a> in Amsterdam in 2014, and a bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a> in 2011.

In between finishing the masters and starting the PhD, I worked for a while at the Software Improvement Group, where I was co-author of two books on software (team) quality (see <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049159.do">here</a> and <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920048565.do">here</a>).
