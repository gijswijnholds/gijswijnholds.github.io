permalink: /publication/2022-12-22-paper-title-number-19
excerpt: 'We devise a test suite for evaluating Dutch language models&apos; capacity for understanding noun and verb phrase ellipsis. The grammars, paired with a small lexicon, provide us with a large collection of naturalistic utterances, annotated with verb-subject pairings, that serve as the evaluation test bed for an attention-based span selection probe. Our results, backed by extensive analysis, suggest that the models investigated fail in the implicit acquisition of the dependencies examined.'
