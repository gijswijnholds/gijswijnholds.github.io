2022-03-07	published	Discontinuous Constituency and BERT: A Case Study of Dutch	Findings of ACL 2022	We devise a test suite based on a mildly context-sensitive formalism, from which we derive grammars that capture the linguistic phenomena of control verb nesting and verb raising. The grammars, paired with a small lexicon, provide us with a large collection of naturalistic utterances, annotated with verb-subject pairings, that serve as the evaluation test bed for an attention-based span selection probe. Our results, backed by extensive analysis, suggest that the models investigated fail in the implicit acquisition of the dependencies examined.	Kogkalidis, K. and Wijnholds, G. (2022).
